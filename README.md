# MainlightNode for Unity3D Shadergraph (Custom function node)

Originally made by ciro-unity for an older version shader graphs custom nodes 
(https://gist.github.com/ciro-unity/a55d73bcda93ca149cf7fd7e407f8812)

But now remade to be used in Unity3D's new form of custom nodes (custom function).


P.s mainLight.attenuation gave an error so I made a quick fix, so feel free to help out
